# Num-Teller

## Overview
**Num-Teller** is a Python-based desktop application that converts any number you input into its equivalent written form. The application is built using the **Tkinter** library for the graphical user interface, and its design is inspired by a pink **Casio calculator**, offering a stylish and functional tool for your numerical needs.

## Features
- Input any numeric value and get its representation in words.
- Simple and intuitive interface, resembling a classic calculator design.
- Responsive and user-friendly layout for ease of use.
- Supports large numbers and maintains accuracy in conversion.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **GUI Library**: Tkinter

## Design Inspiration
The interface design is inspired by the elegant aesthetics of a pink Casio calculator. This touch of nostalgia adds a charming and familiar look to the application while maintaining its practicality.

## How to Use
1. Install Python and Tkinter in your computer.
2. run from terminal
    ```bash
   python interfaz.py
4. Enter any number in the input field.
5. Press the "Calcular" button to see the number written in words.
